## Concept CLIs / Mock CLI
In general, make it super simple to "fake" a wanted CLI, even make it "just good enough" 
to bring the point across.
E.g. write the functionality by:
- API (command) first
- Implementation using other existing commands and programs
- clear output 
- Ability to document/record a demo
